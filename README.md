  This is a small program which automatically creates an account for ProtonVPN using a temporary mail, in Google Chrome.
  Just download the .exe and run it from anywhere.
  The username that you will need to login will be at the top right corner of the browser window once the process is finished,
and the password is "kjkszpj0" without quotes (don't ask me why).
